rdiscd - IPv6 Router Discovery and SLAAC Daemon
===============================================

rdiscd is a daemon for performing IPv6 router discovery and stateless
address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) in userspace.  It provides greater
flexibility and more functionality than the kernel's implementation.
For example, rdiscd supports static interface IDs, where the advertised
prefix is combined with a static suffix to form a complete address.
It also supports the draft standard for "stable privacy addresses"
(draft-ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses).

rdiscd was written by Andrew Ayer <agwa at andrewayer dot name>.
For more information, see <https://www.agwa.name/projects/rdiscd>.


DEPENDENCIES

libndp v1.2 or higher <http://libndp.org/>

To build you need a C++ compiler (such as gcc) and development
headers for libndp.


BUILDING RDISCD

Run 'make'.


CURRENT STATUS

The current version of rdiscd is 0.3, released on 2014-03-28.  rdiscd aims
to be bug-free and reliable, meaning it shouldn't crash or malfunction.
In fact, it is used in production on several servers, desktops, and laptops.
However, it has not yet reached maturity, meaning it is not as polished or
featureful as it should be.  It contains basic support for autoconfiguring
addresses and the default gateway, but does not yet support route or
DNS server advertisements.
