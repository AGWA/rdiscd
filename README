rdiscd - IPv6 Router Discovery and SLAAC Daemon
===============================================

rdiscd is a daemon for performing IPv6 router discovery and stateless
address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) in userspace.  It provides greater
flexibility and more functionality than the kernel's implementation.
For example, rdiscd supports static interface IDs, where the advertised
prefix is combined with a static suffix to form a complete address.
It also supports RFC 7217 for generating semantically opaque interface
IDs (aka "stable privacy addresses").


DOWNLOADING RDISCD

 PGP Signature: <https://www.agwa.name/projects/downloads/rdiscd-0.6.tar.gz.asc>


DEPENDENCIES

libndp v1.2 or higher <http://libndp.org/>

To build rdiscd, you need:

  * GNU Make
  * A C++ compiler supporting C++11 (e.g. GCC 4.7 or higher)
  * Development files for libndp


BUILDING RDISCD

Run 'make' and 'make install'.

The following Makefile variables can be passed on the command line to
'make' and 'make install':

	PREFIX=/path	Install to given path (default: /usr/local)

	ENABLE_MAN=yes|no
			Whether to build/install the man page (default: yes)

	ENABLE_IFUPDOWN=yes|no
			Whether to install ifupdown hooks (default: no)

	DESTDIR=/path	Stage installed files under the given path
			instead of installing directly to the filesystem
			(intended for package building)

Example:
	make PREFIX=/usr
	make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/pkgroot


CURRENT STATUS

The current version of rdiscd is 0.6, released on 2017-04-16.  rdiscd aims
to be bug-free and reliable, meaning it shouldn't crash or malfunction.
In fact, it is used in production on several servers, desktops, and laptops.
However, it has not yet reached maturity, meaning it is not as polished or
featureful as it should be.  It contains basic support for autoconfiguring
addresses and the default gateway, but does not yet support route or
DNS server advertisements.
