Description: IPv6 Router Discovery and SLAAC Daemon
 rdiscd is a daemon for performing IPv6 router discovery and stateless
 address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) in userspace.  It provides greater
 flexibility and more functionality than the kernel's implementation.
 For example, rdiscd supports static interface IDs, where the advertised
 prefix is combined with a static suffix to form a complete address.
 It also supports the draft standard for "stable privacy addresses"
 (draft-ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses).
